    <p> This is a report based on  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">Kaggle</a> dataset about Google play store application.
    The dataset contained <em>NaN</em>, <em>missing values</em> or <em>invalid strings</em>, therefore we had to clean it first by using Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy (View <a href="firstPage/dataPreprocessing.html">notebook</a>).<br>
    It is possible to see a sample below.
    </p>
    <label for="data">Number of rows:</label><input id="data" type="number" min="1" max="50" value="10" /></label>
    <section style="overflow-x: auto;" id = "csv"></section>

    <p>First we looked at the distribution of ratings: most of the users rate an application between 4.3 and 4.5. Furthermore, it is noticeable how an user who enjoy an app tend to rate it directly with 5 instead of picking up a more thoughtful rate. </p>

    <h3><em>Categories Analysis</em></h3>
    <p>We can dive into our data to gain more interesting information by looking at the mean of some features grouped by category <br>
    First, by using a boxplot, we can show how ratings are distributed among categories:  </p>
    <section class="image boxp" id="box-plot"></section>
    <p><strong>Health and Fitness </strong> and <strong> Events</strong> are the categories with the highest median value (the best developed). On the other hand, <em>Dating</em> is the category with the lowest median value. It might probably demonstrate that these apps are not developed as good as the applications belonging to the former categories.</p>
    <p> We can now use bar charts to show how different features ( i.e. number of download, size of the app, app prices, and number of reviews)  are distributed among categories. </p>
</article>

    <section style="overflow-x:auto;">
    <table id="tab-categories">
        <tr><td><section id="reviews_mean"></section></td><td><section id="installs_mean"></section></td></tr>
        <tr><td><section id="prices_mean"></section></td><td><section id="sizeMega_mean"></section></td></tr>
    </table>
    </section>
    <p>These graphs show that games are predominant in the Google Play store. Although they have on average a big size, they still are the apps downloaded the most and, as expected, with the highest number of reviews.
        By looking at the <em>Categories Vs Price</em> bar chart, we can notice that <em>Finance</em> and <em>Lifestyle</em> applications are the most expensive. Hence, they do not have a big number of downloads and reviews.</p>
