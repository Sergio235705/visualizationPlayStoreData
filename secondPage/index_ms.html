    <h3 class="text"><em>Rating vs Reviews Analysis</em> </h3>
    <p class="text">

        By analyzing the relationship between ratings and reviews it is immediate to notice that the most extreme rating values, like 5 or 1 are based
        on a very small amount of reviews. What is of striking evidence at a first glance is that the highest number of reviews are related to ratings around 4.5. We can also notice
        the that the applications that require some kind of subscription or payment have a smaller amount of reviews and  have mainly positive ratings.

    <h3 class="text"><em>Rating vs Downloads Analysis</em></h3>
    <p>
        The analysis of this graphs leads us to the understanding of the relationship between ratings and downloads. The objective of this visualization is to understand whether or not
        people are interested in the rating of applications when it comes to choose which to download. As expected we can state with some accuracy that free apps are installed a lot more than
        paid app and that the rating strongly influences the decision of downloading. The curious aspect is that , as in the previous graph, we have a peak of installs around 4.5, and then  we start
        decreasing again. Paid apps follow a similar trend with less installs.

    <h3 class="text"><em>Rating vs Size Analysis</em></h3>
    <p class="text">
        The analysis of this graphs leads us to the understanding of the relationship between ratings and size. The objective of this visualization is to understand whether or not
        heavy apps have better ratings than light apps. This graph shows with striking evidence that the number of free apps is higher than the number of paid apps. It is also evident how
        heavy paid apps have high ratings.

    <h3 class="text"><em>Rating vs Price Analysis</em></h3>
    <p class="text">
        The analysis of this graphs leads us to the understanding of the relationship between ratings and price. By computing a mean for each rating range it is clear that
        the most expensive apps have a rating between 3.5 and 4. Such result is interesting since we would expect top rated apps to have the highest price.
