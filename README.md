# Visualization Play Store data.

Web visualization and simple analysis of apps data from the Play store that can is shown at <a href='https://faviasono.github.io/visualizationPlayStoreData/'></a>
Project on Visualisation @Politecnico di Torino that focused on visualization techniques, taking into account rules, good practices, and accessability concepts for web pages. 

We used a dataset on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">Kaggle</a>, we cleaned it and adjusted for our purposes, and create interesting viz with Javascript.  Specifically, we used the following libraries:

* Jquery
* Jquery-csv
* Lodash
* Plotly

Using static webpages on github does result in a problem in the initial table plot. However, the last two pages contain the most interesting visualizations of the data.
Hope you enjoy it!
